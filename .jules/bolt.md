## 2024-05-23 - No Image Optimization Tools
**Learning:** The environment lacks media manipulation tools (no `ffmpeg`, no `imagemagick`, no `PIL`).
**Action:** When encountering unoptimized media assets, focus on HTML-level optimizations (lazy loading, preloading attributes) rather than trying to resize/compress assets directly, unless external tools are allowed (not in this constrained environment).
